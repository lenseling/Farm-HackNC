## What is Begonia Grove?

Begonia Grove is a heartfelt, coming of age visual novel constructed completely in the engine Ren'Py. For those unfamiliar with Ren'Py, it utilizes python scripting to create interactive experiences.

## Synopsis

You are a 28 year old who has been living in the city for all their life. Seeking change, you arrive at your P.O. box to find a letter telling you
that you have inherited the farm of your late grandfather. You must now embark on a new chapter in your life to manage this mysterious farm, meet new suitors, and find yourself along the way.
